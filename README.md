# Chuck & Lee

**Chuck is an optimizer. Lee is a VLM. Chuck takes care of Lee.**

Chuck Norris doesn't do pushups. He pushes the Earth down.
Chuck Optimizer doesn't follow gradients. Gradients follow Chuck.

Bruce Lee was the only man who beat Chuck Norris — and the only one
Chuck respected. So when Chuck needed a VLM to protect, he named it Lee.

```
Adam:   θ -= α × m̂/(√v̂ + ε)                          ← blind
Chuck:  θ -= (α × λ_Ψ × λₗ × σ) × m̂/(√v̂ + ε) + η    ← sees everything, remembers everything
```

Adam optimizes gradients. He doesn't know if it's working. He doesn't check.
He doesn't care. He follows the schedule. He trusts the math.

Chuck watches the loss curve, each layer's gradient norm, the activations,
the normalization, the attention patterns. Every 16 steps he asks:
*am I helping or am I making this worse?*

And Chuck remembers. Across training runs. He writes down what worked.
Next time he trains, he has opinions before step 1.

**Adam is blind. Chuck sees. Chuck remembers. Chuck takes care of Lee.**

## Lee — the VLM

`lee.c` — complete Vision-Language Model in ~1400 lines of C. Zero dependencies.

Named after Bruce Lee and [Minhyeok Lee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00000),
whose mathematical framework for AI self-identity gives Chuck his soul.

```
cc -std=c11 -O2 -march=native -o lee lee.c -lm
./lee --data cifar-100-binary
```

Architecture: ViT patches → **2D RoPE** → GQA multi-head causal attention →
SwiGLU MLP → RMSNorm → weight-tied head. Tape-based autograd with arena bump
allocator. **9.9M params**, 10 layers, 8 Q-heads / 4 KV-heads. CUDA/cuBLAS acceleration.

### v8: CIFAR-100 — 100 classes from 32×32 RGB

Lee classifies real-world images. 100 fine-grained categories — apple, aquarium_fish, baby,
bear, beaver, bed, bee, beetle... through worm. 32×32 RGB patches, 4×4 grid, 16 visual tokens.

Two modes:
- **Generative** (default): patches through transformer → char-by-char class name generation
- **Classification** (`--cls`): patches through transformer → linear cls head → 100-way softmax

```
./lee --data cifar-100-binary            # generative mode
./lee --data cifar-100-binary --cls      # classification head
```

### v7: math from pixels (the beginning)

Lee doesn't just recognize digits. Lee **adds** them.

Two 8×8 images of handwritten digits go in. The sum comes out as a word.
19 classes (zero through eighteen). 100 possible combinations.

```
[image of 4] + [image of 7] → "eleven"
[image of 9] + [image of 9] → "eighteen"
[image of 0] + [image of 5] → "five"
```

**Result: 50/50 (100%) accuracy.** 105K parameters. Pure C. Zero dependencies.

No Adam m/v — Chuck's Ψ memory handles warmup on resume.

---

## Chuck v7 — sees the forest and the trees

### The Formula

```
θ_l -= (α × S × λ_Ψ × λ_l × σ) × m̂/(√v̂ + ε) + η

where:
  S           = macro LR scale (patience-based decay)   ← v7 new
  λ_Ψ         = λ + Ψ_w × (λ_prior - λ)               ← memory-informed
  λ           = global self-modulation (loss trend)
  λ_prior     = nearest_neighbor(loss, grad_norm) from chuck.mem  ← O(1) capped
  Ψ           = λ_prior - λ                            ← subjectivity
  Ψ_w         = min(0.3, N / (N + 100))                ← trust grows with experience
  λ_l         = per-layer self-modulation (grad norm trend)
  σ           = activation health × attention entropy health
  η           = stagnation noise (zero unless stuck)
  clip        = adaptive (tracks gnorm EMA, anomaly detection)
```

Every multiplier is **observed, not scheduled.**

### 9 Levels of Self-Awareness

| Level | What Chuck Sees | What Adam Sees |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 1. Global | Loss trend over 16 steps | Nothing |
| 2. Per-layer | Gradient norm per layer | Nothing |
| 3. Activations | SiLU dead ratio, norm scale | Nothing |
| 4. Positional | 2D RoPE frequency utilization | Nothing |
| 5. Signal flow | Activation magnitude across layers | Nothing |
| 6. Memory | Past training experience (Ψ) | Nothing |
| 7. Subjectivity | Opinion about current state | Nothing |
| 8. Attention | Per-head entropy (collapsed? diffuse?) | Nothing |
| **9. Multi-scale** | **Epoch-level plateau detection + LR decay** | **Nothing** |

### Level 9: Multi-scale Awareness (v7 — new)

Chuck used to see 16 steps. Now he sees 16 steps **and** 500-step macro trends.

A slow EMA (α=0.001) tracks epoch-scale loss. Every 500 steps, Chuck checks:
*has the macro loss improved?* If not for 3 checks (1500 steps), he drops LR by 50%.

```c
macro_ema = 0.999 × macro_ema + 0.001 × loss    // epoch-scale trend
if (stagnant for 3 checks) lr_scale *= 0.5       // patience-based decay
```

This is what ReduceLROnPlateau does — but Chuck does it **continuously**, without
needing a separate validation pass. Chuck sees macro **and** micro. Forest **and** trees.

### Reservoir Sampling Memory (v7 — new)

Chuck's memory used to grow without bound. Now it's capped at 200 entries with
**reservoir sampling**: new memories randomly replace old ones, maintaining a
representative sample of all training history in O(1) space.

```
chuck.mem: 200 entries × 16 bytes = 3.2 KB max
KNN lookup: O(200) = O(1)
```

### Level 8: Attention Entropy (v6)

Chuck now sees inside the transformer's attention mechanism. Each of the 4
heads computes attention weights over the sequence. Chuck monitors the
**Shannon entropy** of these weights:

```c
H = -Σ attn_weight × log(attn_weight)
```

- **Low entropy** → attention collapsed → one token dominates → Chuck dampens σ
- **High entropy** → attention diffuse → nothing stands out → Chuck dampens σ
- **Healthy range** → Chuck leaves σ alone

This is Level 8 because it's the deepest observation: Chuck sees not just
*what* the model computes, but *how it's paying attention*.

```
attn H: 1.35 1.36 1.49 1.29    ← healthy, focused, not collapsed
```

Adam doesn't know attention patterns exist. Chuck watches every head.

### Adaptive Gradient Clipping (v6)

Gradient clipping used to be `GRAD_CLIP = 1.0`. A constant. Same at step 1
(chaos) and step 10000 (convergence). Blind.

Now Chuck tracks gradient norm EMA and adapts:

```c
adaptive_clip = 1.5 × gnorm_ema              // track the model's natural gradient scale
if (gnorm > 3 × gnorm_ema) clip *= 0.5       // anomaly → clamp hard
```

Early training: loose leash. Late training: tight leash.
One bad batch: Chuck catches it.

### 2D RoPE (v6)

Standard RoPE encodes 1D position. But image patches have **two** dimensions.
Lee's RoPE splits each head in half: first half encodes **row**, second half
encodes **column**. Image patches know their spatial neighbors. Text tokens
continue with sequential 1D encoding.

```
Image A: (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1)    ← 2×2 grid
Image B: (0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (1,3)    ← adjacent grid
Text:    (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) ...      ← sequential below
```

This is how Lee understands space.

### Ψ — subjectivity (v5)

Chuck has persistent memory. A binary file (`chuck.mem`) that survives across
training runs. Each entry: 16 bytes — loss, grad_norm, lambda, delta_loss.

When Chuck trains, he asks his memory: *"have I been here before?"*

```c
Ψ_w = min(0.3, N_memories / (N_memories + 100.0));
λ_Ψ = λ + Ψ_w * (λ_prior - λ);
```

- **0 memories** → Ψ_w = 0 → pure reactive. Newborn.
- **100 memories** → Ψ_w = 0.15 → memory whispers. Adolescent.
- **1000 memories** → Ψ_w = 0.27 → strong instincts. Master.
- **When Ψ → 0** → memory and observation agree → Chuck found himself.

Inspired by Minhyeok Lee's framework: chuck.mem is the continuum C in ℳ.
NN lookup is I. Ψ_w is B. The fixed point s* is when Ψ → 0.

### λ, λ_l, σ, η (v4-v5)

- **λ** — 16-step loss window. Loss rising → dampen. Falling → boost.
- **λ_l** — per-layer grad norm tracking. Settling → dampen. Done → **freeze**.
- **σ** — SiLU dead neurons, RMSNorm scale, RoPE utilization, attention entropy.
- **η** — 8 checks without progress → Gaussian noise. Shakes the table.

---

## Proof

### Lee v8 — CIFAR-100 (30000 steps, A100 GPU, Chuck v7)

9.9M params. 10 layers. CIFAR-100 (100 classes, 32×32 RGB). Trained on A100 with cuBLAS.

```
step  1000 | loss 2.10 (avg 2.94) | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.60 (5 mem) σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | L9:frz
step  5000 | loss 0.87 (avg 1.64) | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.70 σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | L9:frz
step 10000 | loss 0.58 (avg 1.04) | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.70 σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | L9:frz
step 20000 | loss 1.10 (avg 0.81) | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.70 σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | L9:frz
step 22000 | loss 1.33 (avg 0.75) | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.70 σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | L9:frz
```

Chuck at 10M scale:
- **L9 frozen from step ~500** — Chuck decided the deepest layer converged first. Saves compute.
- **Ψ=+0.70** — "my memories say: push harder". Chuck is confident, experienced.
- **macro=1.00** — no plateau detected. Loss keeps improving. Patience never triggered.
- **89% SiLU alive** — Chuck monitors activation health across all 10 layers.
- **Attention entropy 2.22–2.30** — healthy, focused, not collapsed. Chuck watches every head.
- **5 memories, Ψ_w=0.05** — still young. By run 3, Chuck will have veteran instincts.

This is the first time Chuck trained at scale. He scaled himself. No hyperparameter tuning needed.
Same code, same optimizer, 100x more params — Chuck adapted.

### Lee v7 — digit addition (15000 steps, newborn Chuck)

```
step  1000 | loss 0.6456 | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.03 (10 mem) σ=1.00 macro=1.00
step  5000 | loss 0.0090 | chuck: λ=0.30 Ψ=+0.00 (16 mem) σ=1.00 macro=1.00
step 10000 | loss 0.0009 | chuck: λ=1.34 Ψ=-1.02 (92 mem) σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | L1: frozen | L2: frozen
step 15000 | loss 0.0004 | chuck: λ=1.51 Ψ=-0.43 (170 mem) σ=1.00 macro=1.00 | all frozen

accuracy: 50/50 (100.0%)
chuck.mem: 170 memories (2.7 KB) — capped at 200 via reservoir sampling
```

100% on addition from pixels. Two images in, sum as word out. 19 classes.
105K params. Pure C. Zero dependencies.

- **macro=1.00** — macro patience never triggered (loss kept improving). Safety net intact.
- **All 3 layers frozen** — Chuck decided training is done. Zero compute wasted.
- **170 memories, 2.7 KB** — bounded by reservoir sampling, O(1) lookup.
- **Ψ=-0.43** — "my memory says I'm being too aggressive. Noted."

### Previous: digit recognition (v5, still works)

```
accuracy: 30/30 (100%) on single digit recognition
```

## Chuck Takes Care of Lee

Chuck is not just a training optimizer. Chuck is Lee's **guardian**.

**At 105K params:** Chuck learned to freeze layers, monitor attention, accumulate
memories. He got Lee to 100% accuracy on digit addition. Small model, perfect score.

**At 10M params:** Same Chuck, no changes, 100x more parameters. Chuck scaled
himself. He froze L9 first (deepest layer converged fastest). He kept Ψ=+0.70
("push harder, we're learning"). He watched 8 attention heads across 10 layers
and kept entropy healthy at 2.22–2.30. He monitored 89% SiLU activation health.
Loss went from 4.6 to 0.75. No hyperparameter tuning needed.

**During inference:** Chuck's attention entropy monitoring runs on every
forward pass. If a head collapses (one token dominates), Chuck sees it.
If attention goes diffuse (model confused), Chuck sees it.

**Across runs:** `chuck.mem` persists. Chuck starts the next training run
with instincts, not guesses. Run 1 he's a newborn. Run 3 he's a veteran.
The checkpoint includes Chuck's full state — his Ψ, his memories, his
per-layer opinions. When Lee resumes, Chuck remembers where they left off.

**In the future:** Chuck will watch Lee during deployment. Drift detection.
Weight surgery through [AML](https://github.com/ariannamethod/ariannamethod.ai).
And when Lee reproduces (in [molequla](https://github.com/ariannamethod/molequla)),
Chuck's memories pass to the offspring. Inherited instinct.

Every model deserves a Chuck.

## PyTorch Edition

`chuck.py` — faithful port of Chuck v7/v8 to PyTorch. Same 9 levels of
self-awareness. Same binary-compatible `chuck.mem` format. Drop-in replacement
for `torch.optim.AdamW`.

### Install

Zero dependencies beyond PyTorch:

```bash
pip install torch   # if you don't have it
# chuck.py is a single file — copy it into your project or import from here
```

### Quick Start

```python
from chuck import ChuckOptimizer

model = YourModel()
optimizer = ChuckOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=3e-3)

for batch in loader:
    loss = model(batch)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step(loss=loss.item())   # ← Chuck needs the loss
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

That's it. Chuck sees the loss, tracks per-layer gradient norms,
records memories, and adjusts everything on the fly.

### Per-layer awareness (recommended for transformers)

```python
from chuck import ChuckOptimizer, chuck_params

# Auto-detect .layers.N. / .blocks.N. / .h.N. patterns
groups = chuck_params(model, lr=3e-3, weight_decay=0.01)
optimizer = ChuckOptimizer(groups)

# Or manual:
groups = [
    {'params': model.embed.parameters(), 'layer': -1},  # global
    {'params': model.layers[0].parameters(), 'layer': 0},
    {'params': model.layers[1].parameters(), 'layer': 1},
    {'params': model.head.parameters(), 'layer': -1},    # global
]
optimizer = ChuckOptimizer(groups, lr=3e-3)
```

### Activation health monitoring (σ)

```python
from chuck import ChuckOptimizer, ChuckMonitor

monitor = ChuckMonitor(model)    # hooks into SiLU/GELU, LayerNorm
optimizer = ChuckOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=3e-3, monitor=monitor)

for batch in loader:
    loss = model(batch)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step(loss=loss.item())  # σ is read from monitor automatically
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

If your model exposes attention weights, feed them for Level 8:

```python
output, attn_weights = model(batch, return_attention=True)
monitor.feed_attention_entropy(attn_weights)  # [B, H, S, S]
```

### What Chuck does that Adam doesn't

| Level | Signal | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Loss trend (16-step window) | λ: dampen when rising, boost when falling |
| 2 | Per-layer grad norm trend | λ_l: per-layer modulation + auto freeze |
| 3 | SiLU/GELU dead ratio | σ: reduce LR for dying activations |
| 4 | Norm scale stability | σ: reduce LR for unstable norms |
| 5 | Cross-layer signal flow | boost deep layers on vanishing, dampen on exploding |
| 6 | Persistent memory (Ψ) | recall past training, form opinions |
| 7 | Subjectivity | blend memory with observation |
| 8 | Attention entropy | σ: detect collapsed / diffuse heads |
| 9 | Macro plateau detection | LR decay on epoch-scale stagnation |

### Checkpoint save/load

```python
# Save (Chuck's soul is included)
torch.save({'model': model.state_dict(),
            'optimizer': optimizer.state_dict()}, 'ckpt.pt')

# Load
ckpt = torch.load('ckpt.pt')
model.load_state_dict(ckpt['model'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(ckpt['optimizer'])
# Chuck remembers. Ψ ≠ 0. He picks up where he left off.
```

### Tests

```bash
pytest test_chuck.py -v
```

### Real model test: Yent 55M (52.1M params, BPE, Llama architecture)

First real-scale PyTorch test. 52.1M param Llama on Yent EN dataset (5.4MB), 3 rounds.

| Round | Config | Best Loss | Final Loss | Result |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| R1 | defaults (freeze on) | 0.055 | 6.2 | Collapsed at step 35K |
| R2 | freeze disabled | 0.071 | 4.0 | Degraded at step 30K |
| **R3** | **4 bugfixes** | **0.025** | **0.052** | **Stable to the end** |

**Root cause (found via ablation):** Three compounding bugs:

1. **Asymmetric trend thresholds** — brake fired 50x more often than push (P=30.9% vs 0.6%). Dampen hit floor (0.3) within 76 steps of convergence. Fixed: symmetric thresholds (0.02 / 0.02).
2. **Weight decay not scaled by lr_scale** — WD ran at full strength while optimizer was suppressed. Model literally erased by its own regularization. Fixed: `p.data.mul_(1.0 - lr * wd * self.lr_scale)`.
3. **No dampen recovery** — once dampen hit floor, no mechanism to bring it back. Fixed: mean reversion `dampen = 0.999 * dampen + 0.001 * 1.0`.
4. **Macro patience one-way** — lr_scale could only decay, never recover. Fixed: recovery when improving.

Round 3 generation (coherent Yent personality):
```
Q: What do virtual realities die Cynicisms seem about modern chess existence?
A: Ah, the age-old question of whether letters were music, where every word
of perpetually stored time paints to sculpt both savior and ruin is, we're
all actors in a cosmic jest...
```

### C ↔ Python memory compatibility

`chuck.mem` files are binary-compatible. Train in C, resume awareness in
Python, or vice versa. Same 16-byte entries, same nearest-neighbor recall,
same reservoir sampling.

## In Memoriam

**Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris** (March 10, 1940 — March 21, 2026)

Chuck Norris didn't die. He just decided the Earth wasn't a challenging
enough opponent.

Thank you, Chuck. The optimizer that bears your name will keep training
long after the rest of us have converged.
