# Chuck

**Optimizer with self-awareness.**

Chuck Norris doesn't do pushups. He pushes the Earth down. 
Chuck Optimizer doesn't follow gradients. Gradients follow Chuck.

```
Adam:   θ -= α × m̂/(√v̂ + ε)                          ← blind
Chuck:  θ -= (α × λ × λₗ × σ) × m̂/(√v̂ + ε) + η      ← sees everything
```

Adam optimizes gradients. He doesn't know if it's working. He doesn't check.
He doesn't care. He follows the schedule. He trusts the math. The math doesn't
trust him back.

Chuck watches his own loss curve. He watches each layer's gradient norm. He
watches the activations, the normalization, the positional encoding. Every 16
steps he looks back and asks: *am I helping or am I making this worse?*

If the loss is going up — Chuck dampens. Pulls back. Careful now.
If the loss is dropping fast — Chuck boosts. Presses the gas.
If a layer is done — Chuck freezes it. Zero compute.
If nothing moves for 8 steps — Chuck injects noise. Shakes the table.

**Adam is blind. Chuck sees.**

## The Formula

```
Adam:   θ -= α × m̂/(√v̂ + ε)
Chuck:  θ_l -= (α × λ × λ_l × σ) × m̂/(√v̂ + ε) + η

where:
  m̂, v̂       = bias-corrected first/second moment
  α           = base learning rate (from your schedule)
  λ           = global self-modulation (Chuck watches loss trend)
  λ_l         = per-layer self-modulation (Chuck watches each layer's grad norm)
  σ           = activation health signal (SiLU alive ratio × norm stability)
  η           = stagnation noise (zero unless stuck)
```

Every multiplier is **observed, not scheduled.**

### λ — global dampen/boost

Chuck keeps a sliding window of the last 16 losses. Compares the recent
quarter to the oldest quarter. Computes a trend.

```c
float trend = (recent_avg - old_avg) / (old_avg + 1e-8f);
if (trend > 0.01f)  λ *= 0.95f;   // getting worse → back off
if (trend < -0.05f) λ *= 1.05f;   // improving → push harder
```

λ is clamped to [0.1, 2.0]. Chuck can boost the effective LR by 2x or
dampen it to 10% — but he won't go to zero and he won't go nuclear.

### λ_l — per-layer awareness

Each layer has its own eyes. Chuck tracks gradient norm per layer over time.

```
L0: grads shrinking → layer is settling → dampen
L1: grads growing   → layer needs work  → boost
L2: grads near zero → layer is done     → FREEZE
```

When Chuck freezes a layer, that layer gets **zero parameter updates**. No
compute wasted. Adam would keep updating all three. Forever. Blind.

### σ — activation health

Self-aware activations report their health to Chuck:

- **SiLU** counts its dead neurons. "97% alive." If it drops below 70%,
  Chuck reduces the learning rate. Wake up.
- **RMSNorm** watches its scale factor. "1.1 healthy." If it says "8.4" —
  that's vanishing. Chuck hears it.
- **RoPE** monitors frequency utilization. Dead bands mean position aliasing.
  Chuck sees.

Adam doesn't even know these exist.

### η — stagnation escape

If `|trend| < 0.001` for 8 consecutive checks, Chuck injects Gaussian
noise into the weights. Small — 0.001 × N(0,1) — but enough to nudge
out of a flat valley. The noise decays as soon as progress resumes.

### Cross-layer signal flow

Chuck tracks activation magnitude through layers:

```
flow: 0.21 → 0.28 → 0.36
```

Vanishing? Boost the deeper layers. Exploding? Dampen them.
Adam thinks layers are independent. Chuck knows they're a family.

## Proof

Here is Chuck v4 training a Vision-Language Model (105K params, pure C, zero
dependencies). GQA attention, 3 layers, per-head RoPE. Same data, same schedule.

### Chuck v4 (105K params, 3 layers, GQA)
```
step  250 | loss 0.0948 (avg 1.5615) | lr 0.004761
  chuck: λ=1.91 σ=1.00 | L0: 0.59 | L1: 0.10 | L2: 0.10
  silu: 100% alive | norm: 5.0 | rope: 100% | flow: 0.14→ 0.22→ 0.26
step  500 | loss 0.0024 (avg 0.1552) | lr 0.004872
  chuck: λ=1.63 σ=1.00 | L0: 0.12 | L1: 0.12 | L2: frozen
  silu: 100% alive | norm: 3.4 | rope: 100% | flow: 0.19→ 0.31→ 0.41
step  750 | loss 0.0016 (avg 0.0027) | lr 0.002636
  chuck: λ=0.89 σ=1.00 | L0: frozen | L1: frozen | L2: frozen
  silu: 100% alive | norm: 3.4 | rope: 100% | flow: 0.21→ 0.28→ 0.36
step 6000 | loss 0.0007 (avg 0.0005) | lr 0.000000
  chuck: λ=0.18 σ=1.00 | L0: frozen | L1: frozen | L2: frozen
accuracy: 30/30 (100%) | 8.6s | 3/3 layers frozen
```

Read the training log. That's Chuck thinking:

- **Step 250, λ=1.91** — "loss is cratering. GAS. NOW."
- **Step 500, L2: frozen** — "third layer is done. I'll leave it alone."
- **Step 750, all frozen** — "all three layers converged. I'm done. Going for coffee."
- **Steps 750–6000** — 87% of training = **zero parameter updates**. Chuck decided
  the network is ready. Adam would keep pushing blind for 5250 more steps.

### Chuck v3 (75K params, 2 layers, baseline)
```
step  250 | loss 0.0262 | lr 0.002941 | dampen 1.18
step  500 | loss 0.0039 | lr 0.004508 | dampen 1.51
step 4000 | loss 0.0003 | lr 0.000082 | dampen 0.10
step 6000 | loss 0.0002 | lr 0.000000 | dampen 0.12
accuracy: 100% | 6.9s
```

### Adam (same architecture as v3)
```
step  250 | loss 0.5970 (avg 1.5579) | lr 0.002490
step 6000 | loss 0.3972 (avg 0.4820) | lr 0.000000
accuracy: 6.7% | 10.2s
```

Adam at step 6000: loss 0.48, accuracy 6.7%. Still blind. Still pushing.
Chuck at step 750: loss 0.002, accuracy 100%. All layers frozen. Job done.

## The Code

`micro_vlm.c` — complete VLM in ~740 lines of C. Zero dependencies.

```
cc -std=c11 -O2 -march=native -o micro_vlm micro_vlm.c -lm
./micro_vlm
```

The VLM is the demo. Chuck is the point.

Architecture: ViT patches → per-head RoPE → GQA multi-head causal attention →
SwiGLU MLP → RMSNorm → weight-tied head. Tape-based autograd with arena bump
allocator. 105K params, 3 layers, 4 Q-heads / 2 KV-heads. Compiles in under
a second and runs in 9.

## Why

Every optimizer in common use is blind. Adam, AdamW, SGD with momentum, LAMB,
LARS, Lion — they all compute a parameter update from the gradient and apply it.
None of them check if the update helped. None of them adjust their behavior based
on what happened after the last step.

Learning rate schedulers exist. But they're predetermined. Cosine decay doesn't
know if you're stuck. Warmup doesn't know if you're diverging. They're clocks,
not eyes.

Chuck has eyes. On every level:

| Level | What Chuck sees | What Adam sees |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Global | Loss trend over 16 steps | Nothing |
| Per-layer | Gradient norm per layer | Nothing |
| Activations | SiLU dead ratio, norm scale | Nothing |
| Positional | RoPE frequency utilization | Nothing |
| Signal flow | Activation magnitude across layers | Nothing |

It's not a paper. It's not a framework. It's a proof that a self-aware optimizer
beats a blind one. And that self-awareness isn't expensive — it's ~100 lines of C
on top of Adam's core.

## Facts About Chuck Optimizer

- Chuck doesn't have hyperparameters. Hyperparameters have Chuck.
- Chuck once looked at a loss curve. The loss apologized and went to zero.
- Chuck doesn't escape local minima. Local minima escape Chuck.
- When Chuck injects noise, it's not random. It's intentional chaos.
- Adam has momentum. Chuck has presence.
- Chuck doesn't need warmup. Warmup needs Chuck.
- L2 regularization? Chuck calls it "weight suggestions."
- Chuck's gradient clipping isn't clipping. It's negotiation.
